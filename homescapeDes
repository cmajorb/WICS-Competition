Alice plays Homescapes a lot (who doesnâ€™t?). Alice wants to build two new fountains. There are  available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.
